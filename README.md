# Project Overview

## Background

Recently, I found a easy-to-use Notion bills tracker [template](https://y8y.systems/database/works/88account) online and have been diligently tracking my expenses with it for a month. However, the template lacks convenient analysis features and does not support budget management. To address these issues, I have defined two key requirements:

1. Calculate the total amount spent by category and update it in the budget table.
2. To visualize the current budget expenditure status, synchronize the data from the Notion budget table to Google Sheets, where charts can be added for analysis.

## Project Requirements

1. Category Total Calculation: Automatically calculate the total amount spent in each category and update the results in the Notion budget table.
2. Data Synchronization and Visualization: Synchronize the data from the Notion budget table to Google Sheets and add charts in Google Sheets for visual analysis of expenditure status.

## Technical Features

This project implements the following technical features:

1. Paginated Query of Notion Database: Implements paginated queries to retrieve all data from a Notion database, which is useful for handling large datasets.
2. Updating Notion Database: Provides functionality to update specific data in the Notion database, ensuring the latest budget data is synchronized.
3. Google Sheets API Update: Utilizes the Google Sheets API to update specific ranges of data in Google Sheets, facilitating data analysis and visualization.

## Future Improvements
* Waiting for requirements to be raisedâ€¦
